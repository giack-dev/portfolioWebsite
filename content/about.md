Hi, I am Giacomo Peretti. I was born on December 2, 2006 in Turin, Italy. 

I've always liked playing around and tinkering with computers and during the last year of middle school I developed a passion for software engineering and coding. I use Arch Linux and i support the open source software community.

I am currently studying at the Pininfarina Technical Institute, a high school focused on programming located in Turin. In the future, I would like to become a backend developer.

In my free time I like to go out with friends, but more than anything I love playing BasketballüèÄ.
