This is a little game I coded in which you are a squid that has to dodge evil squids trying to kill you

I made it using the Godot game engine, it is currently published on [itch.io](https://giackdev.itch.io/dodge-the-creeps) and the source code is currently available on [github](https://github.com/giack-dev/dodgeTheCreeps/)
